# Cryptocurrency Converter - Go

## Running

In order to run this program, you must have Go installed (I did not want to Dockerize the build process).

With Go installed, the following can be used to build and run the program:

```sh
# Build the program.
go build

# Run the code
./cryptoconv 100 BTC ETH
```
